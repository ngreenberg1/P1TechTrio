## **Architecture Decision**
>  ### 3. Decision Title: User Input Validation
> **Context:** The user input allows mutiple rovers to be added to a list, a size plateau and movement commands so rovers can be tracked. This ensures there is no limitations with the program as list holds all rover instances.
>
> **Strengths(Pros):** The user instructions are clear and understandable in what program is asking to be inputted and to close the program. This is structured so program can handle multiple rovers with the repeated rovers.
>
> **Consequences(Cons):** In future development, additional handling can be integrated such that EOF(End of File) is used rather than close.
>
>
> **Status:** Accepted
