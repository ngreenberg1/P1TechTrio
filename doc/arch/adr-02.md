## **Architecture Decision**
>  ### 2. Decision Title: Testing Modular
> **Context:** Modular Testing (Unit Testing) is an approach of how specific parts of the system are expected to behave by pinpointing at which module/methods are failing.
>
> **Strengths(Pros):** This module allows for there to isolated testing to pick up on early bug detection and behavior of each unit test is clear in how Rover and Plateau is supposed to respond.
>
> **Consequences(Cons):** The Modular testing does not always account for how Rover will interact with different parts of the system leading to limited scopes.

> **Status:**  proposed, accepted, superseded
